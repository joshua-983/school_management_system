# Views Architecture

## Module Structure
- `student_views.py` - Student management (CRUD operations)
- `fee_views.py` - Fee management and reporting  
- `timetable_views.py` - Schedule management
- `attendance_views.py` - Attendance tracking
- `analytics_views.py` - Data analysis and dashboards

## Design Patterns
- Class-Based Views for CRUD operations
- Mixins for authentication and permissions
- Modular organization by business domain
